      <description>Ruby, PHP and a lot other languages rely on system libraries to provide some features in their own ecosystems. It times to times leads to this kind of error
Library not loaded: /usr/local/lib/libjpeg.8.dylib  A large majority of developers on OSX use Brew package manager to install the libraries they need. On the above library loading error, the immediate reaction is so to brew install it
brew install libjpeg Warning: jpeg 9c is already installed and up-to-date To reinstall 9c, run `brew reinstall jpeg`  In most of the cases, you don&amp;rsquo;t have the library missing installed and you can continue with you main task.</description>

As a software developer, I work with Docker quite rarely. I create at the beginning of a project:
 the scripts to build the needed custom docker images the scripts to launch quickly the docker containers and that&amp;rsquo;s almost all.  If you&amp;rsquo;re like me, you probably forget quickly the Docker way or the tips and after 30 mins of déjà vu digging, you get frustrated.</description>
